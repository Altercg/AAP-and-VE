# Adaptive Augmention Pool and Voting with Expertise

## 1. About Adaptive Augmention Pool and Voting with Expertise

We propose an adaptive framework to construct a suitable augmentation pool for DFU medical images and a strategy named “voting with expertise”, which prioritizes predictions with adequate prediction values. We won second place by combining the above two improvements in the ongoing open challenge - [the DFUC2021 Challenge](https://dfu-2021.grand-challenge.org).
